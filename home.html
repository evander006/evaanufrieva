            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Eva Anufrieva is me, an ordinary girl living in Belarus. Or not so simple as It may sound? And that's right. By 2022 I'd managed to do some things that not everyone is capable of. I have dreamt of creating my own website from scratch in HTML. So, that's the result! I picked up every piece of useful information that I use ot used on a daily basis to succeed. Keep that and enjoy the space of the Internet!</p>
            <p>I'm sharing all links, books, websites, resourses and etc. with anyone who comes to my website with the willingness of determination. Apparently, I'm sure that everyone will be pleased to have an opportunity to study for free.</p>
